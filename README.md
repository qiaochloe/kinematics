# Kinematics Equation Solver

Accepts six inputs: change in position, initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, and change in time. Needs at least four of the six inputs to return a solution. Returns both sets of solutions if they exist. Graphs the change in position, velocity, and acceleration using matplotlib.
